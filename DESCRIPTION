Description: This package aims at providing a simple and efficient interface for manipulation and 
    transformation of data for training forecasting models. This is effectively done through 
    "slicing" operations, which transform standard tabular time series data into data.frames usable 
    for model fitting/forecasting, as well as diverse transforms.
