#' Automated pipeline for shape manipulation and data transforms
#' 
#' This package aims at providing a simple and efficient interface for manipulation and 
#' transformation of data for training forecasting models. This is effectively done through 
#' "slicing" operations, which transform standard tabular time series data into data.frames usable 
#' for model fitting/forecasting, as well as diverse transforms.
